                Hi Altschoolers, welcome to my website. My name is Jude Agu, a dark skinned Nigerian male from the South Eastern part of Nigeria.
                My Birthday is the 25th of August. I had my undergraduate degree from the Abia State University and i am currently self-employed.
                I enjoy playing chess, singing and working out in the gym during my spare time.
                I have always been intrigued by the events and developments in tHe world of tech and also by how technological developments influences every aspects of ones life. This intrigue is what led me to consider a career switch to tech.
                going by this decision, I joined the Semptember 2023 Cohort of AltschoolAfrica and i am currently enrolled in the School of Engineering.
                My Altschool ID is ALT/SOE/023/3216.

                As was earlier mentioned, I have always been intrigued by the events and developments in the world of tech and also by how technological developments influences every aspects of ones life. 
                I had ventured into the self taught path, learning basics of computer science and programming by watching some Youtube videos, but found it quite difficult to cope due to lack of guidance and motivation.
                I realized that i might do better following a well structured educational programme and i began to ask questions and conduct online researches on what online coding bootcamps offered quality services.
                During my research, i stumbled across an article written by a former student of Altcschool about the coding program offered by AltSchool Africa. This article explained how a detailed course was being taught at the academy by well qualified instructors. 
                From this article i was able to viualize a community style coding tutorial program which was geared at transforming newbies like myself to superstar software developers.
                So far, i have no regrets signing up with Altschool Africa as it has lived up to the billing.
